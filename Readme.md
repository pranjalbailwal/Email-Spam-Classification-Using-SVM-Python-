Hello!

This project uses the enron email data set of ham and spam.
After training the model we can input our email and it can predict if it is a spam or not.

I have used the Support Vector Machine model for this classification with kernel, c and gamma autoset with the best values.
It is completely written in Python with the use of native libraries.


All the files of the project have to be kept in the same folder and without changing the names because in the code, relative path reference is being given for the datasets folder.

The enron1 folder consists of the datasets for training the model - it contains folders HAM and SPAM which have the emails already classified as HAM and SPAM.
