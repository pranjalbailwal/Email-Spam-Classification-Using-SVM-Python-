Hello!

This project uses the enron email data set of ham and spam.
After training the model we can input our email and it can predict if it is a spam or not.

I have used the Support Vector Machine model for this classification with kernel, c and gamma autoset with the best values.
It is completely written in Python with the use of native libraries.
